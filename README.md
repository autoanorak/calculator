# odin-calculator

Features to add:
- toggle negative/positive number
- exponents (instead of toggle negative positive)
- make operator buttons diferent color from other buttons
- make displayed number blink when operator is pressed
- remove the different border style that appears when you focus on the input element (only seems to apply in Chrome)
- move cursor to end of string, no matter where the user clicks on the display, so that the backspace only works from the end of the string, and the user can't delete characters in the middle of the string if they click there
- add feature to show history of operations
