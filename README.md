# Calculator

#### Video demo: <url>

#### Overview
This is a web-based calculator application. 

The app is able to perform basic calculator functions: add, subtract, multiply, divide, exponentiate, change sign, and clear calculations. 

Users can use either the on-screen buttons or their keyboards to perform the calculator functions.

There are basic user-interface cues, such as buttons that change colour when pressed and a display that flashes when an operator is pressed.

##### index.html
The html file creates the layout for the calculator. Semantic html elements are used where possible.

##### styles.css
The stylesheet uses flexbox to arrange the display window and buttons into a typical calculator layout.

##### scripts.js
The scripts contain several main functions and helper functions which provide the functionality for the calculator app.

#### Future features to implement
- small button to reveal history of operations on a separate display
- introduce distinction between session-clear and currentDisplay-clear, add two btns
- use mono-spaced font for calculator display, history, ?(button text)
